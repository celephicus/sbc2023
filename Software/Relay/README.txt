Project directory for the Relay board as a Microchip Studio solution. It contains two project directories, the Slave project and the ArduinoCore project was auto generated by importing a dummy Arduino sketch, and contains all the Arduino stuff that builds as a static library that is linked to the Slave project to make the final image.

The Slave project contains all the source files, in the following directories. Most are shared with Sensor solution. 
  Slave (files copied from Sensor, synced manually since I couldn't figure out how to share them):
	build.cmd -- Script to generate source files.
	Slave.componentinfo.xml -- saves Microchip Studio state, not important.
	Slave.cppproj -- Project file. 
  Local, NOT shared with Sensor:
	gpio.h gpio.csv -- Source file for generating gpio.h. Dependant on GPIO assignment. 
	project_config.h -- Local configuration for project. 
	regs_local.h -- Local configuration for registers, differs from Sensor only is details of relay or tilt sensor registers. 
  Files included from directory Shared:
	AVR/include/dev.h, src/dev.c -- AVR8 ADC driver & reliable EEPROM driver. 
	Common/include/console.h, src/console.c -- console serial port.
	Common/include/event.h, src/event.c -- Event system, not used.
	Common/include/modbus.h, src/modbus.c -- Master/slave MODBUS driver. 
	Common/include/regs.h, src/regs.c -- Registers library.
	Common/include/sbc2022_modbus.h -- MODBUS definitions common to all projects. 
	Common/include/utils.h, src/utils.c -- Utility functions.
	2022SBC/ADXL345.h SparkFun_ADXL345.cpp SparkFun_ADXL345.h -- Accelerometer driver.
	2022SBC/driver.cpp driver.h -- Drivers, has compile time switches to generate different code for Sensor/Relay.
	2022SBC/Slave.cpp -- Main function, compile time switches for minor differences between Sensor/Relay. 
	
The build.cmd script runs all the code generator scripts and makes local files. It may then be compiled with Studio.

The script mk-relay-arduino.cmd copies all the source files into a single directory for building with the Arduino IDE.
