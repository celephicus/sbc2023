Project directory for the Relay board as a Microchip Studio solution. It contains two project directories, the Slave project and the ArduinoCore project was auto generated by importing a dummy Arduino sketch, and contains all the Arduino stuff that builds as a static library that is linked to the Slave project to make the final image.

The Slave project contains all the source files, in the following directories. Most are shared with Sensor solution. 
  Slave (files copied from Sensor, synced manually):
	ADXL345.h SparkFun_ADXL345.cpp SparkFun_ADXL345.h -- Accelerometer driver.
	build.cmd -- Script to generate source files.
	driver.cpp driver.h -- Drivers, has compile time switches to generate different code for Sensor/Relay.
	files_for_grab.txt -- lists shared files.
	Slave.componentinfo.xml -- saves Microchip Studio state, not important.
	Slave.cpp -- Main function, compile time switches for minor differences between Sensor/Relay. 
	Slave.cppproj -- Project file. 
  Local, NOT shared with Sensor:
	gpio.h gpio.csv -- Source file for generating gpio.h. Dependant on GPIO assignment. 
	project_config.h -- Local configuration for project. 
	regs_local.h -- Local configuration for registers, differs from Sensor only is details of relay or tilt sensor registers. 
  Files included from directory Shared:
	AVR/include/dev.h, src/dev.c -- AVR8 ADC driver & reliable EEPROM driver. 
	Common/include/console.h, src/console.c -- console serial port.
	Common/include/event.h, src/event.c -- Event system, not used.
	Common/include/modbus.h, src/modbus.c -- Master/slave MODBUS driver. 
	Common/include/regs.h, src/regs.c -- Registers library.
	Common/include/sbc2022_modbus.h -- MODBUS definitions common to all projects. 
	Common/include/utils.h, src/utils.c -- Utility functions.
	
	
The build.cmd script runs all the code generator scripts and makes local files. It may then be compiled with Studio.


	directory, others are in the Shared/Common & Shared/AVR dirs.
This dir contains the master project for the MODBUS slaves Relay and Sensor as a Microchip Studio project. By replacing a few header files the project is
transformed into Relay or Sensor. 

Copy the contents of this dir to the Sensor dir, note that the Sensor/repl dir will be untouched.
Rename Slave.atsln file to Sensor.atsln. 
Copy files from dir repl (gpio.csv project_config.h regs_local.h) into Slave dir overwriting existing files from Relay project.
Build.
